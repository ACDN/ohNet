Zapp library
------------

Zapp is a library for the discovery, monitoring, manipulation and implementation
of UPnP devices, generalized to be extensible to other similar protocols.

Prerequisites
-------------

On Windows:
	Microsoft Visual Studio
	(Express versions are okay. Not sure what is the minimum version.)
	Microsoft .NET 3.5 SDK (optional, required for changes to service descriptions)

On Linux:
	Mono (optional, required for changes to service descriptions)

Building
--------

On windows, in the UPnP directory, run:
	make generate-makefiles
	make

On Linux, in the UPnP directory, run:
	make

Installing
----------

See INSTALL.

Directories

Build/
	Generated during the build process. Build artefacts go here.

Build/Obj/Windows/
Build/Obj/Posix/
	Binaries and shared libraries are built to here during a build.

Build/Tools/
	Binaries that are required by the build process are built to here.

Build/Include/
	Header files needed by users of the library are copied here during the build.

Generated/
	Files that come with the distribution but which are generated from
	templates and can be rebuilt if they are deleted.

Scripts/
	Scripts that are needed by the build process.

T4/
	Files related to template-based generation of source and makefiles.

T4/Templates/
	Templates for source and makefiles.

	Source code. (TODO: Describe this better. I've not actually looked through
	the source enough to really understand what goes where. --andreww)


Make targets
------------

all
	This is the default target. It (should) build everything.

generate-makefiles
	This regenerates the makefiles in Generated/ that are derived from the
	service descriptions. GNU make will detect these changes automatically,
	but Microsoft's nmake doesn't handle this, so Windows users will need
	to use this target when the service descriptions or T4 templates for
	the makefiles have been changed.

install
	See INSTALL.

uninstall
	See INSTALL.

clean
	Removes files from Build/Obj/$platform/ and Build/Include/

mostlyclean
	Also removes the auto-generated makefiles from Generated/

maintainer-clean
	Also removes Build/Tools/
	(Should - but doesn't yet - remove auto-generated source files too.)
